## Summary

`Granted` gains two narrow values alongside `all`, so a publisher pre-approves a scope list per product instead of choosing between everything and nothing.

## Motivation

`all` resolves against every cross-product interaction the Host mediates at the moment the grant is used, including interactions added after publication. A wallet that wants a portfolio tracker to read its holdings has to grant `all`, which also pre-approves every account and signing interaction. "Read my stored data, prompt for anything else" is not expressible, so `all` is what gets published.

## Detailed Design

[RFC — Product Manifest Format][manifest] gains two `Granted` values:

```typescript
type Granted = 'all' | 'storage' | 'context';
```

| Value     | Pre-approves                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `all`     | Every cross-product interaction the Host mediates on the granting product's behalf, present and future. |
| `storage` | Reading the granting product's host-local storage. Read-only.                                           |
| `context` | Acting as the granting product's account: reading it and the identity that follows from it, and producing proofs and signatures under its keys. |

`trustedProducts` keeps its `Record<string, Granted[]>` shape, so this needs no new field and no `$v` bump.

- **`all` is a superset, not a peer.** `["all"]` implies `storage` and `context`, so `["all", "storage"]` is `["all"]`. A Host MUST NOT read a narrower value as a restriction on `all`. Enumerating the narrow values covers the same interactions today but does not widen when a further value is defined. That difference is the point of enumerating.
- **Values are a set.** Order is not significant, duplicates collapse.
- **Scopes are independent.** `["storage"]` leaves account interactions prompting as usual, and vice versa.
- **Existing rules are unchanged.** Hosts MUST ignore unrecognised values and MUST NOT fail validation over them, so a Host implementing only `all` reads `["storage"]` as an empty grant and prompts. Publishers MUST NOT emit a value outside `Granted`. A grant never overrides a denial the user already gave.
- **A key names a product, and a product is all its executables.** The key is the segment above the TLD, so `dim2.dot`, `app.dim2.dot` and `worker.dim2.dot` are one grantee: granting `dim2` grants every executable published beneath it. A subname of another domain is that domain — `dim2.attacker.dot` reads as `attacker` and collects nothing published for `dim2`.

Which calls each scope gates remains a Host runtime contract, as it already is for `all`. A grant is a standing answer, so a call it does not cover refuses rather than prompts wherever prompting would itself disclose something — a cross-product storage read answers one refusal for every reason, and a prompt naming the target would say the target exists.

`context` gates `create_account_proof`, `ring_vrf_sign`, `sign_payload`, `create_transaction`, `sign_raw` and the statement-store product proof on the granting product's keys. The decision is taken in two components, and they are not equals:

- The **authority holding the keys** is the gate. It resolves the granting product's manifest for itself and derives the key from the identity it authorized, never from the spelling it was handed. On a paired Host the request arrives over the wire from another Host, which names the product it is acting for, so relaying a verdict to it would take the manifest out of the decision entirely and let a peer reach every handle on the device rather than only the ones a publisher really granted. This is the only gate on that path.
- The **runtime frontend** refuses a cross-product caller before the authority is reached. For a product on this Host it computes the same answer from the same inputs, so it adds no decision the authority would not reach: what it adds is that a refusal costs no authority round-trip, and on a paired Host no wire traffic. Removing it is not a hole, because the authority still refuses; changing it to something other than the grant is a regression, and is what the tests pin.

A cross-product signature is confirmed by the user, and the prompt names the calling product beside the account's own: the grant is the publisher's answer about which product may act, never the user's answer about a signature. The AutoSigning fast path covers only a caller that is the account's own product, so it cannot serve one silently, and the Statement Store proof path raises the confirmation itself because it has no such gate. A relayed signature carries no caller identity at all, and the signing role confirms every one of them.

While the calling product is open, the user confirms each kind of signature once per product that owns the accounts. The kinds are `sign_payload`, `create_transaction`, `sign_raw` and the statement-store product proof. The calling product may sign with the owning product's accounts many times. A game, for example, requests one statement-store product proof per message, so confirming each proof would mean a prompt for every message. After the first confirmation, the calling product makes further signatures of that kind with any of the owning product's accounts without a prompt. Like the account-access decision below, the confirmation is filed against the product on both sides. Each kind is confirmed separately, so confirming a proof does not let a transaction through.

If the user declines, nothing is remembered and the next signature prompts again, so a mistaken tap only refuses that one signature. The confirmation is consulted only after the grant, so it cannot let in a caller the manifest does not grant. These prompts open one at a time, and a signature the user already approved never waits for one.

A transaction that names contacts is confirmed every time, because the signed call returns each contact's account to the product. `sign_raw` without a watermark is also confirmed every time, because the signed bytes cannot be told apart from a transaction.

The grant is consulted after the session, so a caller with no session cannot learn from the refusal whether the account it named would have admitted it, nor make the device resolve a manifest to find out.

A grant never overrides a refusal the user already gave: the stored account-access decision is read-only, so a grant lookup never raises the prompt that would settle an undecided one. It is read after the manifest, not before. Reading it first let a denied pair refuse without the chain lookup every other refusal pays for, and that difference in cost enumerates the user's stored denials to anyone who can name a caller id, which on the wire is anyone the peer chooses to name. The decision is filed against the product on both sides, matching the granularity of the grant it overrides.

The account and identity *reads* `context` names are covered by the grant, not prompted for again: the contextual alias and the proof come out of one VRF evaluation, so a grantee that may `create_account_proof` already holds the alias that proof attests. Prompting for it would ask the user to approve what the grant has already authorized. A refusal the user already gave still overrides, as everywhere else.

## Drawbacks

Writes stay on the wildcard: `storage` is read-only, so "read and write, nothing else" is still inexpressible. `context` bundles reading an account with signing under it, so "see who I am, sign nothing" is not expressible either: splitting them costs a third value and neither half has a use without the other yet. And `all` still widens silently, so staying narrow means revisiting the manifest as scopes are added.

## Alternatives

A separate field per scope (a foreign-storage record beside `trustedProducts`) splits one question — what may this product do to me — across fields that must be read together, and costs a top-level field per future scope. Per-scope operations (`{ storage: ["read", "write"] }`) add a second dimension to the manifest's only unbounded field; a `storage-write` value can land later under the ignore-unrecognised rule.

## Unresolved Questions

1. Is `context` the right name? `account` says it more directly, and `context` sits awkwardly beside the `context` parameter [RFC 0020][0020] removed from `create_transaction`.
2. Should `storage` gain a write counterpart rather than leaving writes reachable only through `all`? A cross-product write is a larger step than a read, and no consumer has asked for one yet, but leaving it on the wildcard means a publisher who wants to allow it must also pre-approve everything else.
