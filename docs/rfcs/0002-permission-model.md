# RFC 0002 — Permission Model for Host API

> **NOTE (2026-05-26): `remote_permission` reverted to a single permission.**
> This RFC below specifies batched remote-permission requests (`remote_permission` taking a `Vec<RemotePermission>`). That part has been rolled back: `remote_permission` again accepts a single `RemotePermission`. After the initial implementation it became clear that the batched API is hard to justify to the end user — a single prompt covering several distinct grants produces bad UX (the user cannot reason about or selectively approve what they are consenting to). The rest of this RFC (device permissions, lifecycle, persistence, implicit triggering) still stands; only the batching of remote permissions is reverted.

> **NOTE (2026-08-18): first-party products hold remote permissions without a prompt.**
> The lifecycle below specifies that every permission is prompted on first request. That holds for device permissions, identity disclosure and cross-product account access, but not for remote permissions requested by a product on the trusted list in `truapi::platform::REMOTE_PERMISSION_TRUSTED_LABELS`. Those products hold every `RemotePermission` variant — domain access, WebRTC, chain submit, preimage submit, statement submit — without a prompt, because they ship alongside the host and their remote access belongs to the host's own trust boundary. The grant is not persisted, so a `Denied` written through the permission administration surface still outranks it and revokes the access; clearing that denial restores the auto-grant. An empty `Remote` domain bundle remains denied, since it grants nothing. The list holds bare product labels with no TLD, so one entry covers the product on every network. This is an interim mechanism: the allowlist is intended to move into the product manifest, per RFC 0024.

> **NOTE (2026-09-18): external navigation uses `OpenUrl`, matching legacy Swift.**
> This revises [#434](https://github.com/paritytech/trinity-user-agents/pull/434), which gated external HTTP(S) navigation by destination domain and exempted application schemes. External `host_navigate_to` calls now require `DevicePermission::OpenUrl`, including allowed application schemes. `AllowAlways` covers future handoffs to any external destination; `AllowOnce` covers one handoff. Domain permissions continue to govern outbound network requests. Internal dotNS, localhost and host-handled Pocket navigation remain exempt.

> **NOTE (2026-09-18): retain the legacy Google Fonts exception.**
> For compatibility, `BLESSED_REMOTE_DOMAINS` lets every product access `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` without a prompt. This covers all paths and query strings on those hosts, not only font requests, and requests disclose the user's IP address to Google. An explicit matching denial overrides the exception. These implicit grants are not stored.

## Summary

The host callback distinguishes `AllowOnce`, `AllowAlways`, and `Deny`.
One-use grants stay in memory for the product execution and are consumed by
the operation that needs them. Requesting permission upfront does not consume
the grant. Product-facing permission responses remain boolean.

The Host API currently has two underdefined permission calls — `host_device_permission` and `remote_permission` — that lack coverage for several device capabilities (NFC, Clipboard, OpenUrl, Biometrics), do not support batched remote-permission requests, and have no specified lifecycle for when prompts occur or how decisions are persisted. This RFC defines the complete set of device and remote permissions, updates the `remote_permission` signature to accept a batch, specifies lasting and one-use permission decisions, and establishes that business methods (`host_sign_raw`, `host_sign_payload`, `host_create_transaction`, `host_create_transaction_with_non_product_account`, `remote_statement_store_submit`, `remote_preimage_submit`, `remote_chain_transaction_broadcast`) implicitly trigger permission prompts if permission has not yet been granted.

## Motivation

The current Host API design document defines two permission functions:

```rust
fn host_device_permission(
  permission: DevicePermissionRequest
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;

fn remote_permission(
  permission: RemotePermission
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;
```

`DevicePermissionRequest` covers only `Camera`, `Microphone`, `Bluetooth`, and `Location`. This is insufficient: products that need clipboard access, the ability to open external URLs in the system browser, biometric authentication, or NFC have no mechanism to declare or request these capabilities.

`remote_permission` accepts a single `RemotePermission` value but the notes call for batched requests. A product that needs HTTP access to several endpoints, plus chain submission, would need to make multiple round-trips and prompt the user multiple times for what is logically a single decision.

Neither function has a documented lifecycle: it is unspecified when the Host prompts the user, whether the decision survives a session restart, or what happens when a business method is called without an explicit prior permission check.

The result is that products cannot predictably reason about which operations will succeed, and hosts cannot implement consistent permission UX without filling in unspecified behaviour themselves.

**Requirements for the solution:**

1. `DevicePermission` must cover: Camera, Microphone, Bluetooth, NFC, Location, Clipboard, OpenUrl, Biometrics.
2. `RemotePermission` must cover: HTTP/HTTPS/WS/WSS access (with domain patterns), chain transaction broadcasting, preimage/bulletin-chain submission, and statement-store submission.
3. `remote_permission` must accept a batch of permissions so a product can declare all its remote needs in a single call.
4. `host_device_permission` remains a single-permission call.
5. The Host prompts the user the first time a permission is requested; subsequent calls for the same permission resolve immediately from persisted state.
6. Business methods that require a permission must implicitly trigger the prompt if the permission has not yet been resolved, returning `PermissionDenied` only when the user actively denies.

## Detailed Design

### Note on Web APIs Integration

Since some interactions with the Web platform cannot be covered by the Host API, the permission system is coupled to the sandbox implementation.
That means that fetch requests, WebSockets, WebRTC, and device permissions should be handled by the Host's sandbox implementation.

`#[wire(internal)]` hides the consuming authorization methods from the product
SDK; it does not authenticate callers. Rust still accepts those calls and
checks permissions for the calling product execution. A direct product call
can consume that execution's one-use grant. `ProductExecutionKind` describes
App, Widget or Worker entrypoints, not whether the caller is the container.

The shared container authorizes operations through generated internal SDK
methods, using the SDK's codecs, request handling and cancellation. Internal
methods and their transport references are protected; public product methods
remain replaceable. Before product code runs, the container freezes the shared
constructors and prototypes used by authorization and prevents extensions to
`Object.prototype`. Products cannot monkey-patch these shared dependencies.
Approved fetches retain native redirect behavior.

### Updated Type Definitions

#### DevicePermission

The existing `DevicePermissionRequest` enum is renamed to `DevicePermission` for consistency and extended:

```rust
enum DevicePermission {
  Notifications,
  Camera,
  Microphone,
  Bluetooth,
  NFC,
  Location,
  Clipboard,
  OpenUrl,
  Biometrics
}
```

- **Notifications** — added to support send native notifications to the user.
- **NFC** — added to support tap-to-pay and NFC tag interactions.
- **Location** — already present; `GPS` from earlier notes is treated as a duplicate and dropped.
- **Clipboard** — read/write access to the system clipboard.
- **OpenUrl** — permission to open URLs in the system browser (external navigation out of the host application).
- **Biometrics** — permission to trigger biometric authentication (fingerprint, Face ID, etc.).

The function signature changes only in the type name:

```rust
fn host_device_permission(
  permission: DevicePermission
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;
```

A single call requests a single permission. Batching is not supported for device permissions; each capability warrants its own prompt.

#### RemotePermission

```rust
enum RemotePermission {
  // Access to Web 2.0 APIs.
  // Each entry is a domain or wildcard subdomain pattern:
  //   "api.coingecko.com"  — exact domain match
  //   "*.coingecko.com"    — all subdomains of coingecko.com
  //   "*"                  — allow all HTTP/WS requests (wildcard)
  Remote(Vec<String>),
  // Access to WebRTC, can be potentially harmful for privacy because
  // it can expose the user's IP address.
  WebRTC,
  // Broadcast signed transactions to any Substrate chain via
  // remote_chain_transaction_broadcast.
  ChainSubmit,
  // Submit preimage data to the bulletin chain via
  // remote_preimage_submit.
  PreimageSubmit,
  // Submit statements to the statement store via
  // remote_statement_store_submit.
  StatementSubmit
}
```

#### Updated remote_permission Signature

`remote_permission` now accepts a `Vec<RemotePermission>` to allow products to declare multiple remote permissions in a single prompt:

```rust
fn remote_permission(
  permissions: Vec<RemotePermission>
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;
```

The return value is a single `bool`. A `true` result means all requested permissions were granted. A `false` result means the user denied at least one permission in the batch; the host MAY persist partial grants for those entries the user approved, but the function still returns `false`. Products that need to know which specific permissions were denied should call `remote_permission` with individual entries.

### Domain Matching Semantics

`Remote(Vec<String>)` authorizes outbound HTTP/WS requests to matching hosts.
External `host_navigate_to` calls use `DevicePermission::OpenUrl`, covering
HTTP(S) URLs and allowed application schemes such as mail, phone, messages and
maps. A one-use grant authorizes one handoff. Internal dotNS, localhost and
host-handled Pocket navigation do not consume an external-navigation grant.

Each string entry is matched against the host portion of the URL. The matching
rules are:

- **Exact domain**: `"api.coingecko.com"` matches requests to `https://api.coingecko.com` only.
- **Wildcard subdomain**: `"*.coingecko.com"` matches descendants at every depth, e.g. `api.coingecko.com`, `cdn.coingecko.com`, and `deep.api.coingecko.com`, but not `coingecko.com` itself.
- **Wildcard all**: `"*"` matches any HTTP(S) host. This is a broad grant and host implementations SHOULD present a more prominent warning to the user when this entry appears.

Wildcard expansion stops at parents with at least two labels, matching legacy
native coverage. A stored `"*.com"` or `"*.dot"` does not authorize concrete hosts;
`"*"` remains the universal pattern. This is a label rule rather than a public
suffix rule, so `"*.co.uk"` covers `example.co.uk`. A grant for a bare parent,
such as `"coingecko.com"`, does not cover its subdomains.

Matching is case-insensitive and runs on the IDNA ASCII form of the host, so
every spelling of the same site — case, trailing root dot, Unicode or punycode —
resolves to one decision and one prompt.

The unit of persistence is the pattern, not the requested bundle: a grant of
`["a.example.com", "b.example.com"]` is stored as a decision for each, so it is
visible to enforcement, which only ever asks about one host at a time. A denial
is not symmetric. Refusing a set of domains is not refusing each of them
individually — the user was never put the narrower question — so a multi-domain
denial is recorded against that set. The same request does not re-prompt, and a
later request for one of those domains alone still gets its own prompt.

### Permission Lifecycle

1. **First request** — When a permission is requested for the first time (either via an explicit permission API call or implicitly by a business method), the Host prompts the user with an approval dialog.
2. **Decision lifetime**: `AllowAlways` and `Deny` are stored for the product and survive restarts. `AllowOnce` stays in memory for the execution and authorizes one operation. It is never converted into a durable grant.
3. **Subsequent requests**: Saved decisions resolve without another prompt. An upfront permission request can observe a one-use grant without consuming it; the operation atomically consumes it. After consumption, the next operation needs another decision unless a lasting grant or an automatic exemption covers it.
4. **Device capabilities are also gated by the OS** — A device permission has a second gate the persisted decision does not describe: the OS grant held by the host application, which the user can revoke in system settings, device policy can suspend, and the platform can reset on its own. A host that can read that state serves `PermissionStatusHost`, and a device capability then resolves as usable only while both gates are open. An OS refusal denies the request without a prompt, since only system settings can reach it, and leaves the persisted product decision in place for when the user restores the OS grant. An OS grant that is merely undetermined does not change the answer: the OS puts its own dialog up when the capability is used, and the core cannot reach that dialog without also re-asking the product's question, which step 3 forbids. Reading a status without prompting resolves the same two gates, so a host settings screen and a request cannot disagree about whether a capability is usable. A host that cannot report OS state resolves from the persisted decision alone.
5. **Revocation** — Revocation of the product-scoped decision is out of scope for this RFC. Hosts MAY provide a settings interface for users to revoke permissions, but the protocol does not define a revocation notification to the product.

Products MAY request permissions lazily (on first use) or upfront during initialization. Both patterns are valid. Requesting upfront is recommended when the product can predict its needs, as it provides a better user experience by batching consent into a single moment.

The shared fetch, XHR and WebSocket wrappers validate the request URL with
captured browser URL primitives and pass its hostname to the internal
`authorize_remote_permission` method. Rust normalizes the host and resolves
its domain permission, consuming a one-use grant when applicable. The fetch
and XHR wrappers check the initial URL; native requests retain the legacy
redirect behavior. Redirect targets and DOM resource loads are not separately
checked by these wrappers. Swift supplies native callbacks, such as the
permission dialog, but does not forward authorization messages.

Before each `getUserMedia` request, the container calls the internal
`authorize_device_permission` method for each requested capability, camera
before microphone. Each approval consumes its one-use grant for that attempt.
If microphone permission is denied after camera approval, the camera grant
has already been consumed; a native capture failure does not restore grants
either. The returned stream remains usable until stopped. Another capture
requires new authorization, including when WebKit reuses its native decision.

The container enforces product consent in the product's realm; native media
delegates enforce OS permission without consuming product consent again.
This relies on installing the container before product code in every frame
and locking the native methods and their prototypes. The authorization
transport and its response handler stay private, with browser primitives
captured before product code runs. Replacing collection or Promise methods
therefore cannot obtain a pending approval callback, unlike the earlier
asynchronous gate. A native OS grant alone is not product consent.

Synchronous XHR, `Worker`, `WebTransport` and `getDisplayMedia` screen capture
are unavailable. Workers would provide a separate realm with unguarded
network APIs; WebTransport has no permission wrapper, and screen capture has
no product permission.

### Implicit Permission Triggering by Business Methods

The following business methods gate on a specific permission and MUST internally trigger a permission prompt if the permission has not yet been resolved:

| Business Method                      | Required Permission                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `remote_chain_transaction_broadcast` | `RemotePermission::ChainSubmit`           |
| `remote_preimage_submit`             | `RemotePermission::PreimageSubmit`        |
| `remote_statement_store_submit`      | `RemotePermission::StatementSubmit`       |
| `host_navigate_to`                   | `DevicePermission::OpenUrl`               |
| `send_push_notification`             | `DevicePermission::Notifications`         |

`host_navigate_to` consumes `OpenUrl` for external HTTP(S) destinations and
allowed application schemes (`mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:`, `maps:`, `polkadot:`,
`dot:`). Internal dotNS, localhost and host-handled Pocket navigation consume
no grant. Denial is reported as `HostNavigateToError::PermissionDenied`.

The following business methods relate to signing and require the user's active consent via their own approval flow (e.g. a signing confirmation dialog). They return `PermissionDenied` when the user cancels or denies that confirmation — this is distinct from the remote permission system but is documented here for completeness:

| Business Method                                    | Error on Denial                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `host_sign_raw`                                    | `SigningErr::PermissionDenied`           |
| `host_sign_payload`                                | `SigningErr::PermissionDenied`           |
| `host_create_transaction`                          | `CreateTransactionErr::PermissionDenied` |
| `host_create_transaction_with_non_product_account` | `CreateTransactionErr::PermissionDenied` |

For the remote-gated methods: if the user has already granted the relevant `RemotePermission`, the business method proceeds without prompting. If permission is not yet resolved, the Host presents the permission prompt first, then proceeds or returns `GenericErr` (wrapping a permission-denied reason) if the user denies.

> **Design rationale:** Requiring products to always call `remote_permission` before calling `remote_statement_store_submit` would add boilerplate with no safety benefit, since the Host already controls whether the operation proceeds. Implicit triggering lets simple products work correctly without explicit permission preambles while preserving full user control.

### Complete Updated Interface (Permissions Section)

```rust
// Updated DevicePermission enum (replaces DevicePermissionRequest)
enum DevicePermission {
  Notifications,
  Camera,
  Microphone,
  Bluetooth,
  NFC,
  Location,
  Clipboard,
  OpenUrl,
  Biometrics
}

// Updated RemotePermission enum
enum RemotePermission {
  Remote(Vec<String>),
  WebRTC,
  ChainSubmit,
  PreimageSubmit,
  StatementSubmit
}

// Single-permission device request (unchanged semantics, updated type name)
fn host_device_permission(
  permission: DevicePermission
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;

// Batched remote permission request (signature updated: Vec<RemotePermission>)
fn remote_permission(
  permissions: Vec<RemotePermission>
) -> Result<bool, GenericErr>;
```

### Serialization Impact

The `Payload` enum in the transport layer derives its action indices from the order of Host API methods. The changes here affect two existing entries:

- `host_device_permission_request` / `host_device_permission_response` — the payload type changes from `DevicePermissionRequest` to `DevicePermission`. This is a rename; the variant index in the `Payload` enum is unchanged.
- `remote_permission_request` / `remote_permission_response` — the payload changes from `Versioned<RemotePermission>` to `Versioned<Vec<RemotePermission>>`. This is a structural change.

Both changes are breaking at the wire level. See Compatibility in Alternatives below.

## Drawbacks

**Batch semantics are coarse.** `remote_permission` returns a single boolean for a batch. A product requesting `[Http(["api.example.com"]), ChainSubmit]` cannot distinguish "Http denied, ChainSubmit granted" from "both denied" without making two separate calls. This is a deliberate simplicity trade-off; products that need fine-grained feedback should issue individual permission requests.

**Wildcard `"*"` for HTTP is permissive.** Allowing a product to request HTTP access to any domain with a single entry reduces the safety value of the permission system for that specific case. The Host MUST communicate this clearly in its prompt UI.

**No revocation protocol.** Once a product has a permission, it retains it until the user manually revokes it through host settings. There is no push notification to the product when a permission is revoked. Products should handle `GenericErr` responses from business methods as a signal to re-prompt if desired.

**A denial does not say which gate closed.** `granted: false` covers both a product-scoped refusal and an OS-level one, so a product cannot tell "you declined this" from "the OS revoked this, open system settings" — and the two have different remedies. Distinguishing them needs a richer device-permission response than the current `granted` boolean, so it waits for a breaking-change window.

**Implicit triggering couples permission UX to business-method UX.** When `remote_statement_store_submit` triggers a permission prompt inline, it interrupts the flow the product expected to be a simple network call. Products that want a controlled UX should call `remote_permission` proactively before entering the relevant flow.

## Alternatives

### Compatibility and Migration

This RFC introduces breaking changes:

1. **`DevicePermissionRequest` → `DevicePermission`**: Implementors referencing `DevicePermissionRequest` by name must update to `DevicePermission`. The wire encoding of the existing four variants (`Camera`, `Microphone`, `Bluetooth`, `Location`) is unchanged — variant indices are preserved.

2. **`remote_permission` argument type**: The payload changes from a single `RemotePermission` to `Vec<RemotePermission>`. Any host or product implementation that encodes or decodes `remote_permission_request` must be updated. A single-element `Vec` is the direct migration path for callers that previously passed one permission.

3. **New `DevicePermission` variants**: `NFC`, `Clipboard`, `OpenUrl`, and `Biometrics` are new enum variants appended after the existing four. Older hosts that receive an unrecognized variant SHOULD return `false` (permission not granted) rather than an error, to allow graceful degradation.

4. **New `RemotePermission` variants**: `PreimageSubmit` and `StatementSubmit` are new variants. Older hosts that receive an unrecognized variant in a batch SHOULD treat it as denied and return `false`.

Migration is straightforward for implementors following semantic versioning: bump the major version, update type names, and wrap single-permission calls in a `vec![...]`.

### Prior Art and References

- [Host API Design Document](../design/truapi-protocol.md) — the current API definition this RFC amends.
- [Web platform Permissions API](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/) — the W3C model for browser permission prompts: one-time prompt, persisted decision, queryable state. The lifecycle defined here follows the same pattern.
- [Android permission model](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) — similar grant-once-persist approach; also distinguishes install-time (declared) permissions from runtime (prompted) permissions.

## Unresolved Questions

1. **Partial-batch grants**: Should `remote_permission` return a structured result (e.g. `Vec<(RemotePermission, bool)>`) instead of a single `bool`? This would allow products to proceed with whichever permissions were granted. The current proposal opts for simplicity, but this trade-off should be confirmed by the fellowship.

2. **Permission query API**: Should there be a `remote_permission_status` / `host_device_permission_status` call that returns the current persisted state without prompting? This would allow products to check permission state on startup and adapt their UI accordingly without triggering a prompt.

3. **`OpenUrl` scope**: settled. External navigation requires `OpenUrl`, matching legacy behavior. Remote-domain permission applies to outbound requests; opening a link does not require both grants (see [Domain Matching Semantics](#domain-matching-semantics)).

4. **HTTP/WS permission enforcement point**: The RFC specifies that `RemotePermission::Remote` governs outbound HTTP/WS requests, but the transport layer routes all network calls through the Host. How the Host enforces HTTP domain matching at the transport level (interception vs. validation before handing off) is an implementation detail left unspecified — should this RFC say more?

5. **Permission revocation notifications**: A follow-on RFC could define a `host_permission_revoked_subscribe` subscription that products receive when the user revokes a permission via Host settings.

6. **Permission expiry**: Time-bounded permissions (e.g. "allow for this session only") would give users finer control and reduce the risk of persistent over-permission.
