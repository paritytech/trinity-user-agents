"""Mutation sweep over the RFC-0006 top-up guards (iOS port).

Adapted from `feature/products/impl/tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py` in the Android repo. Same spirit:
touch only the files that decide a top-up's fate and run only the top-up tests. Each mutant removes or
weakens exactly one rule the host call's contract states — idempotency, one-claim-per-source, terminality,
verdict immutability, group namespacing, and the translation from what coinage detected
into what a product is told.

Read a SURVIVED line as "no test distinguishes this rule's presence from its absence".

The sweep first runs the suite unmutated and refuses to continue unless it passes: a broken simulator or
a failing baseline would otherwise report every mutant as killed. Any run that ends without a clear
xcodebuild verdict aborts the sweep for the same reason.

iOS split note: on Android the coinage→product status translation lives in `ExecuteTopUpUseCase`, in scope
for these tests. On iOS the amount/shortfall arithmetic lives one layer down, in the claim services
(`ClaimCoinsService`/`ClaimAssetService`), which the top-up tests stub. The asset claim loop's exit guards
are covered by `ClaimAssetServiceTests` and swept here; the rest of the claim arithmetic is not.

Usage, from the repository root:
    python3 Packages/Coinage/Tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py
    python3 Packages/Coinage/Tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py --list
    python3 Packages/Coinage/Tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py --check
    python3 Packages/Coinage/Tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py --sim <simulator-udid>
    python3 Packages/Coinage/Tools/top_up_mutation_sweep.py --only "claim:" --only "window:"

Sources are restored on every exit path — normal exit, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM — and the restore is verified before
the script returns.
