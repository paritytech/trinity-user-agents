# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

This repo is the single source of truth for the TrUAPI protocol. It vendors `dotli` as a git submodule at `hosts/dotli/`.

## Layout

```
rust/crates/
  truapi/                Rust trait + type definitions for protocol versions v0.1 and v0.2 (canonical)
  truapi-codegen/        rustdoc JSON → TypeScript client + Rust dispatcher
  truapi-macros/         #[wire(id = N)] proc-macro
  truapi-platform/       Host syscall traits (storage, navigation, consent, ...)
  truapi-provider/       network provider backends (WebSocket RPC or smoldot light-client)
  truapi-server/         Rust runtime hosts implement; ships as WASM (browser/node)
  truapi-polkavm-host/  optional native composition pinned to
                        paritytech/polkavm-host-runtime
js/packages/
  truapi/                  @parity/truapi TS package; generated TS lives under ignored paths
  truapi-host/            @parity/truapi-host: WASM-backed host runtime. Subpath entries:
                          `.` (shared host types), `/web` (iframe + Web
                          Worker), `/worker-runtime` (Worker entry).
                          WASM bundle (gitignored) under dist/wasm/web/, built via `make wasm`
  truapi-debugger/        @parity/truapi-debugger (published to npm): the debugger.
                          Owns all decoding of the wire frames the Rust host tap
                          (truapi-server's DebugSink) streams out, and decodes
                          every frame by default (no denylist, no reveal toggle).
                          Holds the trace, envelope-decode, and value-decode
                          engines, the shared view model + renderers, and two
                          mounts over them: server.ts (standalone WS+HTTP app on
                          127.0.0.1:9231 that hosts dial into, `npm run serve`;
                          endpoints /, /op-list, /op, /view, /channels, /stats,
                          /traces, /frame) and in-app.ts (createInAppDebugger:
                          same-page host, no server, no dial). @parity/truapi has
                          no debug seam. Where the app ultimately lives is still
                          an open decision.
js/container/              TS lockdown container for the iOS host web view; `npm run build`

The PolkaVM runtime implementation, wire crates, browser package, and ABI
contract live in `paritytech/polkavm-host-runtime`. The base `truapi-server`
must remain PolkaVM-free. Native integrations use the optional
`truapi-polkavm-host` composition crate; browser integrations consume
`@parity/polkavm-browser-runtime` directly. Never copy or export browser assets
from this repository.

### Crate + binding invariants

- `truapi` is canonical; runtime crates re-export rather than redefine. New
  syscall traits and host-side runtime types live in `truapi-platform` and
  `truapi-server`, not in `truapi`. Any additions to `truapi` itself are limited
  to additive `Display` impls.
- Treat concrete modules such as `truapi::v01` as implementation details of
  the canonical `truapi` crate and its version-conversion impls. Everywhere
  else, import concrete protocol payload and error types from `truapi::latest`.
  This includes structs reused by host-internal APIs that are not exposed to
  products; if such a type is missing, re-export it through `truapi::latest`
  rather than importing a concrete protocol version. Runtime crates may use
  `truapi::versioned::*` for wire envelopes, but should unwrap them into latest
  payloads immediately.
- Native bindings expose canonical Rust domain and protocol types directly.
  Add feature-gated UniFFI derives to those types and custom conversions for
  unsupported leaf values instead of defining parallel `Native*` mirrors.
  Boundary-specific native types are reserved for lifecycle or callback
  behavior that has no canonical value-type equivalent.
- `truapi-host-cli`'s crate version tracks `js/packages/truapi/package.json`,
  kept in sync by `scripts/sync-release-versions.mjs`. A
  `release: @parity/truapi <version>` therefore also publishes prebuilt
  `truapi-host` binaries through `.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`: one
  archive per target (`aarch64-apple-darwin`, `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`) plus a `.sha256`, uploaded to the
  `@parity/truapi@<version>` release, followed by the `truapi-host-cli-stable`
  pointer that `scripts/truapi-host-installer.sh` and the CLI's own updater
  read. Release asset URLs must percent-encode the tag
  (`%40parity%2Ftruapi%40<version>`). `make cli-dist CLI_TARGET=<triple>`
  reproduces one archive locally, and `make e2e-cli-update` installs and
  self-updates it against a loopback release server.
- `truapi-server` WASM artifacts live under
  `js/packages/truapi-host/dist/wasm/web/` and are gitignored.
  Build them locally with `make wasm` (rerun whenever
  `rust/crates/truapi-server/` changes). CI compiles the crate for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` to guard the wasm bridge and its offline subxt
  surface, but does not build or publish the packaged bundle; run `make wasm`
  locally before relying on the browser host.
- The UniFFI bindings and the container bundle are gitignored build outputs.
  After changing UniFFI-exposed types or native bindings, run
  `./ios/truapi-host/scripts/rebuild.sh` to refresh them locally; when only the
  bindings changed, `make uniffi && ./ios/truapi-host/scripts/sync-bindings.sh`
  does that part without Xcode. Because nothing is committed, CI regenerates
  rather than diffs: the `ios-bindings` job proves every UniFFI-exposed type
  still has a binding representation, and the `ios-swift` job generates the
  package's Swift sources and container resource and then compiles the package
  and its test target, which is what catches a hand-written conformer that
  missed a new protocol requirement. `ios-swift` is path-filtered, and the
  filter has to name every crate the bindings are generated from, since a
  protocol change no longer leaves an `ios/` diff to key on. On the Kotlin side
  the `ci-android` job compiles
  `TrUAPIHost.kt` against freshly generated bindings on pull requests touching
  `android/` or the native crates, which catches the same class of drift;
  `make android-check` does it locally. The embedding apps are compiled by
  neither.
  Hosts implement `HostBridge`, whose protocol extension defaults the optional
  callbacks; `TrUAPIHostRuntime` and each product execution retain one.
  To publish, include `@parity/ios-host <version>` in the `release:` PR title.
  `release-ios.yml` rebuilds and simulator-tests the XCFramework, uploads it,
  then cuts the plain semver tag `<version>` whose commit carries the generated
  sources and a manifest pointing at that asset. That tag is the SwiftPM
  contract: consumers pin `exact("<version>")`, and a branch cannot be consumed
  directly because the generated sources are ignored there. The job clones and
  compiles the tag before pushing it, then opens a pull request against the
  release branch that points `Package.swift` at the new asset. Dispatching
  `release-ios` manually with a pre-release version cuts a tag for app-side
  testing of an unmerged change without touching any branch. When the title
  also names an npm package, the iOS job waits on that publish being confirmed
  on npm. `publish.sh <version>` is the manual fallback.
  `Package.swift` reads `TRUAPI_USE_LOCAL_BINARY` from the environment to build
  against the rebuilt XCFramework; the tag script refuses a manifest that pins
  the local binary.

## Code style

- Every `pub` Rust item (functions, methods, types, traits, modules, constants) carries a doc comment (`///` or `//!`).
  Keep it short and focused on intent or invariants, not on what the signature already says.
- Do not add code comments or doc comments that narrate migrations, compatibility shims, or historical changes. Comments should describe only the current code.
- Remove legacy compatibility code by default. Keep or add it only when explicitly requested.
- In Rust format strings, prefer inlined variables: `"log value: {value:?}"` over `"log value: {:?}", value`.
- For Rust modules, prefer `foo.rs` plus an optional `foo/` directory for
  child modules. Do not introduce new `foo/mod.rs` files unless preserving
  generated output or an existing external convention.
- In runtime Rust code, prefer `core::` over `std::` for types that are
  available in `core` (`core::pin::Pin`, `core::task::Poll`, `core::fmt`, and
  similar). Keep `std::` for std-only APIs, tests, and std-only programs such
  as `truapi-codegen`.
- **No `any` in TypeScript types**: If a type can't be expressed cleanly, stop and ask the user whether to (a) refactor or import the right type or (b) add a scoped `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` exception. Never silently leave `any`.
- Don't introduce typealias chains that just rename a public type from another crate (e.g. `pub type StorageError = crate::v01::HostLocalStorageReadError`). Use the canonical name directly. A typealias is only worth its indirection when it captures a real abstraction.
- After any code change, update `README.md` (and CLAUDE.md if the layout changed) so the top-level docs reflect what the repo actually contains. Stale docs are a regression. When moving or removing docs, `rg` for the old path and update or remove stale links in README files, agent notes, skills, comments, and design docs.
- In codegen emitters, prefer `indoc::writedoc!` / `formatdoc!` over chains of `writeln!`. A single `writedoc!` with a multi-line raw string keeps the emitted shape visible in source instead of fragmenting it across one-line `writeln!` calls. Reserve `writeln!` for the genuinely-one-line case (a single import, a single statement inside a loop).
- In PR descriptions, issue comments, and other artifacts that outlive the conversation: describe the resulting state, not the transition between commits. Avoid "previously X, now Y", "we removed", "the old shim is gone", "this PR replaces", those read as ephemeral history once the PR is squash-merged. Write what the system _does_ after the change, not what each commit _changed_ on the way there. (Commit messages are the place for transition narrative; they survive in `git log` even after the squash.)

## Explanation style

- For architecture, event-flow, and debugging explanations, start with a short
  direct summary of the model before diving into long details. Prefer simple
  statements like "the host sends a dirty signal; the core re-reads and derives
  auth state" before listing each hop.
- Use diagrams only when they clarify ownership or message flow. Keep them
  layered and label what is per-tab, shared, host-owned, and core-owned.

## First-time setup

```bash
# Check out the dotli submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the TypeScript client (triggers tsc via `prepare`)
( cd js/packages/truapi && npm install )

# Install playground dependencies (picks up @parity/truapi via the file: link)
( cd playground && yarn install --frozen-lockfile )
```

## Regenerating the TS client

When the Rust trait surface changes, rerun:

```bash
./scripts/codegen.sh
```

That will repopulate the ignored generated TS under `js/packages/truapi/src/generated/`,
`js/packages/truapi/src/playground/codegen/`, and `js/packages/truapi/test/generated/examples/`.
After regenerating, rebuild the client and refresh the playground's link copy:

```bash
( cd js/packages/truapi && npm run build )
( cd playground && rm -rf node_modules/@parity && yarn install )
```

(yarn 1.x copies `file:` deps at install time, so the playground's `node_modules/@parity/truapi` is a snapshot.)

## Local development

### Rust

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo +nightly fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

### TypeScript client

```bash
cd js/packages/truapi
npm run build
npm test                # bun test suite (src/**/*.test.ts)
```

### Explorer

The explorer is a standalone Vite/React site (no host needed). To run it
locally, just start its own dev server and open the URL directly in a browser.
**Do not** launch dotli for the explorer.

```bash
cd explorer
npx vite --base / --port 5181   # standalone site at http://localhost:5181/
npm run build                    # static export to dist/
```

Use a port other than 5173 (dotli's conventional port) to avoid stale-tab
confusion.

### Playground

```bash
cd playground
yarn dev                # Next.js dev server on :3000
yarn build              # static export to out/
yarn lint
```

The fastest way to exercise the playground is `truapi-host dev -- yarn dev`
from `playground/`, which starts a signing host on `127.0.0.1:9955`, serves the
browser bridge at `/bootstrap.js`, and runs the dev server with the host live.
The playground's root layout carries the development-only `<script>` tag that
loads it. TCP frame peers and browser origins are limited to loopback. On Unix,
the CLI owns the wrapped command's process group and applies a five-second
SIGTERM grace period before killing remaining descendants.

The playground must otherwise be opened from inside a TrUAPI host. The fastest
local setup is to run dotli's preview server alongside the playground and open
`http://localhost:5173/localhost:3000` in any browser. Use the
[`playground-local-stack`](.claude/skills/playground-local-stack/SKILL.md)
skill to bring both servers up in tmux (it handles the `hosts/dotli/`
submodule init + `bun install` and the per-pane `cd` discipline).
Alternatively, with a deployed Polkadot Desktop Host installed, navigate to
`https://dot.li/localhost:3000` from within it.

#### Local dotli + playground E2E notes

Use `make dev DEBUG=1` from the repo root for the local host stack. It prepares
the ignored WASM/build artifacts, verifies dotli can resolve
`@parity/truapi-host`, then starts dotli on `:5173` and the playground on
`:3000`. Open `http://localhost:5173/localhost:3000`.

When automating with Playwright, block service workers for smoke tests unless
the test is explicitly about SW behavior. Stale host/product bundles can mask
runtime fixes. Use a fresh cache-busting query string on
`http://localhost:5173/localhost:3000?...`, collect `pageerror` and
`console` messages, and fail on unexpected page errors.

For interactive SSO checks, prefer a persistent headed Chrome profile and reuse
the same browser context across checks. SSO pairing needs a real phone QR scan,
and signing/resource-allocation flows may need web or mobile confirmation; if
the human or companion app is unavailable, skip those methods and record the
skip instead of treating it as a protocol failure. Non-interactive checks should
still verify that the playground renders, the TrUAPI debug panel receives
host/product events, generated examples can call non-confirmation methods, and
logout/relogin does not restore a stale session.

The root `make e2e-dotli` target builds the local `truapi-host` binary and
drives the dotli/playground diagnosis through a non-interactive signing-host
CLI process. The CLI answers the QR-derived pairing deeplink, auto-approves
remote requests, stays alive for the SSO session, and is launched again to
verify same-account reconnect after host sign-out. It uses
an explicitly exported `HOST_CLI_SIGNER_MNEMONIC` when present. Without one,
it auto-manages a reusable isolated identity under `.e2e-dotli/`. Set
`E2E_DOTLI_SIGNING_HOST_BASE_PATH` to preserve and reuse signing-host state
while debugging. Use `E2E_DOTLI_SMOKE=1 make e2e-dotli` for the QR-only smoke
path.

For a fully automated local playground diagnosis run, use:

```bash
make e2e-dotli
```

`make e2e-dotli` starts dotli preview and the playground, signs out any
restored host session, signs in through the local signing-host CLI by extracting
the QR payload, runs the playground Diagnosis screen, auto-accepts host-side
Allow/Sign modals, and writes
`playground/test-results/e2e-dotli/diagnosis-report.md`.

Any CI job running the same target needs `DOTLI_CHECKOUT_TOKEN` for private
submodule checkout; without dotli access it should skip this integration gate
rather than fail unrelated checks.

A useful no-phone smoke assertion is:

```bash
E2E_DOTLI_SMOKE=1 make e2e-dotli
```

For manual debugging of that smoke path:

1. Start `make dev DEBUG=1`.
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/localhost:3000?debug=truapi&cachebust=<ts>` with
   service workers blocked.
3. Wait for `globalThis.__truapi?.setLogLevel`, call
   `__truapi.setLogLevel("debug")`, and confirm the console logs
   `[truapi worker] logLevel=debug providers=0`.
4. Click `#auth-button`, wait for `#auth-modal-backdrop.open`, and confirm:
   the modal shows `Login with Polkadot Mobile`, `__truapi.getProviderCount()`
   is greater than zero, worker frame/callback logs appear, and there are no
   page errors.

If `make dev` reports `EADDRINUSE` on `:5173` or the playground moves from
`:3000` to `:3001`, kill stale `preview-server.ts` / `next dev` processes and
restart the tmux session. Port drift causes false-negative local e2e results.

Useful debug signals:

```js
__truapi.setLogLevel("debug");
sessionStorage.setItem("dotli:truapi-debug", "1");
```

Reload after setting the debug-panel flag. Watch for `Unknown wire discriminant`, missing
`@parity/truapi-host` imports, worker WASM instantiation failures, and
debug-panel traffic disappearing when the login popup opens.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy-playground.yml`, which builds `playground/` and publishes the static export via `bulletin-deploy`. Pass the bare dotNS label `truapi-playground`, never a suffixed name: dotNS attaches the top-level domain its network declares, so the live name is `truapi-playground.paseo` on Paseo Next v2. The deploy steps stay in this repo because `bulletin-deploy` ships its shared reusable workflow from a private repo that this public one cannot call.
Pushes to `main` also trigger `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`, which publishes the explorer (at the Pages root), the playground (under `/playground/`), and the Rust API docs (under `/cargo_doc/`) to GitHub Pages.
