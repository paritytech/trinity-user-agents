// Cross-product storage against a real signing-host CLI.
//
// One product writes to its own storage and another reads it, which the manifest
// grant is the only thing permitting. The host resolves that grant from the
// `trustedProducts` in a local product config, which seeds the manifest cache,
// so the granted read runs before either product is deployed and without a
// chain. See `--product-config` and `truapi-host-cli/src/product_config.rs`.
//
// A target with no seeded entry is not chain-free: the cache miss goes to dotNS
// on Asset Hub before refusing, so the `read-missing` phase does reach the
// network.
//
// The runner serves one product per host process, so `scripts/cross-product-storage-e2e.sh`
// invokes this once per phase with `E2E_PHASE` set, pointing every run at the
// same `--base-path` so the storage written in one is there for the next.
//
// Phases, and what each proves:
//
//   write            peopl.paseo stores a value in its own storage.
//   read             dim2.paseo reads it. Named in trustedProducts, so allowed.
//   read-untrusted   stash.paseo reads the same key. Same target, same value,
//                    absent from trustedProducts: refused.
//   read-missing     dim2.paseo reads a product that published nothing. Must be
//                    refused identically to the above, or the call becomes a
//                    probe for which products exist.
//   read-again       dim2.paseo reads once more, so a refusal above cannot be
//                    the value having expired or gone.
