//! Asset Hub PGAS allowance claims.
//!
//! Mirrors the mobile wallet flow: pick the first unclaimed daily PGAS slot for
//! the target, prove membership in the claiming collection with the `AsPgas`
//! transaction extension, and submit `Pgas.claim_pgas` on Asset Hub. The slot
//! budget and the alias space are both per collection, so the claim is bounded by
//! whichever collection it proves.
//!
//! Two chains are involved. The ring and its revision come from the People
//! chain, where membership lives; the claim is submitted on Asset Hub, which
//! learns about People's rings through `MembersSubscriber`. A claim can only be
//! authorized against a revision Asset Hub has already imported, so the flow
//! waits for it rather than submitting a proof the runtime cannot verify.
