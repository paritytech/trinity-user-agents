//! Ledger and driver for automatic statement-store allowance renewal.

//! The ledger records which accounts this signing host promised to keep

//! the active session and runs the chain-pure pass in
//! `statement_allowance::renewal`, either once (`renew_now`) or on a periodic
//! tick (`start_renewal_loop`).
