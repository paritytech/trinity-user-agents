//! Stable host-embedding API for the TrUAPI server runtime.
//!
//! `ProductRuntime` is the target-neutral boundary embedders should use.
//! Platform adapters provide:
//! - a [`crate::platform::Platform`] implementation for host callbacks,
//! - a task [`Spawner`] for runtime-owned async work,
//! - a [`FrameSink`] for outgoing protocol frames.
//!
//! Target-specific shells such as wasm-bindgen, iOS FFI, or desktop IPC should
//! keep their conversion code outside this module.
