//! Capability traits a TrUAPI host must implement.
//!
//! Each trait covers a single OS-primitive surface the Rust core cannot reach
//! from its own process (key-value persistence, URL launching, push
//! notifications, permission UI, chain RPC, host-selected preimage backends).
//! Account management, signing, and statement-store protocol flows live in the

//!
//! Async capability traits use `async_trait` so the combined [`Platform`]
