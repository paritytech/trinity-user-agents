//! Permission authorization state machine (ask -> authorized | denied), backed
//! by the platform [`CoreStorage`] trait with typed [`CoreStorageKey`] slots.
//!
//! Device permissions (camera, mic, NFC, ...) are separate from remote
//! permissions (domain access, chain submit, ...), so this module exposes two
//! `check_or_prompt` entrypoints that route to the matching platform callback.
//! The cache layer is shared but keys are typed so a device grant cannot
//! authorize a remote operation by accident. Keys are also scoped by product id
//! so one product's authorization never grants another product's request.
//! Identity disclosure is also represented as a product-scoped authorization,
//! but the prompt itself is handled by the account runtime because it uses the
//! richer user-confirmation surface rather than the device/remote callbacks.
//! One-use grants stay in memory and are consumed by operation authorization,
//! separately from upfront permission requests.
//!
//! Domain grants (`RemotePermission::Remote`) are the one request that does not
//! occupy a single slot. A product may ask for several domains at once, while
//! outbound-request authorization checks one host at a time. So a grant is
//! stored as one authorization per domain pattern, and a lookup for a concrete
//! host resolves through the
//! RFC 0002 candidate list ([`remote_domain_candidates`]), letting the most
//! specific stored decision win.
//!
//! A denial is not symmetric with that. "No" to a set of domains is not "no" to
//! each of them — the user was never asked the narrower question — so a
//! multi-domain denial is recorded against the exact set that was asked about
//! instead of fanning out. The bundle stays answered, so the same request does
//! not re-prompt, while a later request naming one of those domains on its own
//! still gets a prompt. A one-domain prompt has no narrower question left, and
//! its set-shaped key is that domain's key, so it persists per-domain with no
//! special case.
//!
//! Remote permissions, identity disclosure and account access have one exception.
//! A product listed in [`crate::platform::REMOTE_PERMISSION_TRUSTED_LABELS`]
//! is authorized without reading or writing permission records and never
//! reaches the prompt callback. Device permissions are never covered.
