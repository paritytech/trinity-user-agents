// Ambient declaration of the wasm-pack glue `make wasm` emits to
// `dist/wasm/web/`. Declaring it under `src/` lets the worker import the glue
// by a literal specifier that resolves against `dist/worker-runtime.js` once
// compiled, so bundlers follow it and emit the glue plus its `.wasm` payload
// themselves. Declarations are not emitted, so this file never shadows the
// real artifact, and the typecheck does not require it to have been built.
