/**
 * The runnable debugger app: the WS server a host dials into, plus a minimal
 * trace view.
 *
 * A host's outward WS dial sends one text message per frame -
 * `{ channelId, dir, frame }`, where `frame` is the base64 of the raw SCALE
 * `ProtocolMessage` bytes (JSON can't carry binary; base64 keeps the envelope on
 * one line). Each message is decoded and grouped by {@link createDebugSession}.
 * `GET /traces` returns the grouped traces (payload-blind - raw bytes and
 * decoded values are never serialized); `GET /op` renders one op's drill-down
 * with each frame's decoded value inline; `GET /frame?id=&i=` is the same
 * decode as a programmatic JSON endpoint. Value decode is on by default (a
 * dev-only tool decodes everything); `GET /` serves a page that polls `/op-list`.
 *
 * The exact host↔debugger framing is not yet standardized (envelope spec, track
 * T3); base64-in-JSON is what this server accepts today. Runs under Bun
 * (`bun run src/server.ts`).
 *

 * dialed in; a status bar shows counts and liveness.
 *
 * The client is a thin shell over server-rendered fragments: it polls
 * `/op-list` (the shared {@link renderOperationRow}) and `/channels`, and fetches
 * `/op` when an operation is selected. Every injected fragment is produced and
 * escaped server-side, so `innerHTML` is safe. `/op-list` is payload-blind
 * (shape/timing only); `/op` renders each frame's decoded value inline for a
 * trusted channel. `td-*` classes are owned by the shared renderer.
