# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

An interactive explorer for the TrUAPI, the Host API surface exposed to products running inside the Polkadot Desktop Browser webview. It talks to a host over iframe `postMessage` frames or the `window.__HOST_API_PORT__` MessagePort used by native webviews and the local CLI browser bridge.

For plain-browser development, run `truapi-host dev -- yarn dev` and open
`http://localhost:3000`. The layout loads the CLI's development bridge from
fixed port `9955`. A different `dev --port` requires the script tag to change
with it. To test a real host, run `yarn dev` and open
`https://dot.li/localhost:3000` inside the Desktop Host.
For host-backed diagnosis/e2e runs, `make e2e-dotli` builds and launches the
repo's signing-host CLI. An explicitly exported `HOST_CLI_SIGNER_MNEMONIC` is
used when present; otherwise the CLI auto-manages a reusable isolated test
identity. Set `E2E_DOTLI_SIGNING_HOST_BASE_PATH` to use different state while
debugging.

## Commands

```bash
yarn dev               # Start Next.js dev server (port 3000)
yarn build             # Build static export to out/
yarn start             # Serve out/ locally
yarn lint              # ESLint + tsc --noEmit + tsc -p tsconfig.examples.json
yarn lint:fix          # Auto-fix ESLint issues
yarn typecheck         # tsc --noEmit on playground sources
yarn typecheck:examples # Typecheck generated client examples
yarn test:unit         # Chat diagnosis unit tests
yarn e2e               # Playwright e2e suite
yarn e2e:cli           # Plain-browser suite using the installed truapi-host
yarn e2e:cli-diagnosis # Generate the CLI host compatibility report
```

Set `TRUAPI_HOST_BIN` for either CLI target to use a specific checkout build.
The Playwright target rejects existing listeners and owns teardown. The
diagnosis target may reuse a stack only after both the playground and
`/bootstrap.js` return the expected content. Diagnosed method failures remain
in its JSON report but do not fail the report generator. Browser page errors,
an incomplete report, startup failure, and incomplete teardown do fail it.

The Diagnosis screen emits a per-host markdown report via "Copy report". Aggregation into the cross-host matrix happens in the explorer (see [`../explorer/README.md`](../explorer/README.md#host-compatibility-matrix)). The playground itself owns the diagnosis run and the report format only.

`predev` and `prebuild`/`prelint`/`pretypecheck` automatically run `scripts/bundle-rxjs-dts.mjs` (and, for `predev`, `scripts/write-dev-env.mjs`) so the Monaco editor always has up-to-date rxjs type definitions.

## Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 15 (static export), React 19, TypeScript, Monaco editor (via `@monaco-editor/react`), rxjs, sucrase.
**Output:** `out/` deployed to DotNS via GitHub Actions on push to `main`. The same workflow also publishes the cargo doc HTML at `/cargo_doc/`.

### Key Files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/services.ts` | Filters the generated service metadata to APIs available to an `App` execution. Services requiring `Worker` are owned by the worker diagnosis instead. |
| `src/lib/transport.ts` | Singleton `Provider`/`Transport`/`TrUApiClient` over iframe postMessage or webview MessagePort. Owns the handshake and connection status. |
| `src/lib/example-runner.ts` | Transpiles each rustdoc `ts` example via sucrase, runs it inside an `AsyncFunction` with `truapi`, `console`, rxjs, and an ambient `assert` as bindings. Failure is explicit: an example fails iff it throws (via `assert(...)`, a timeout, or any uncaught error); `console.*` is pure output. A tracking Proxy auto-unsubscribes inner `.subscribe(...)` calls so subscriptions clean up when the run ends or the user navigates away. |
| `src/lib/monaco-setup.ts` | Configures Monaco's TS worker: registers the bundled `@parity/truapi` types (`truapi-dts`), every rxjs `.d.ts`, and an ambient block (`declare const truapi: Client`, `assert`, `crypto`, `Uint8Array` hex helpers) so examples typecheck without manual imports. Defines the light/dark themes that match the design tokens. |
| `src/lib/auto-test.ts` | Runs each method's example and reports pass / fail. A method passes when its example resolves within the timeout and fails when it throws (the thrown/`assert` message plus any logs become the failure output); unary and subscription examples are awaited identically. `runDiagnosis` runs every method one at a time, in service order; methods that prompt the user (signing, permission/resource requests) block on their host dialog before the run continues. `runSingleTest` replays one method (used by the Diagnosis row replay). |
| `src/lib/diagnosis-report.ts` | Adapts App results to the shared deterministic Markdown formatter and adds host-mode detection and issue submission. |
| `shared/diagnosis.ts` | Framework-independent diagnosis result model and Markdown formatter shared by the App and Worker executables. |
| `worker/index.ts` | Coordinates the Chat diagnosis over the generated Chat API, from a `Worker` execution. |
| `worker/diagnosis.ts` | Owns ordered Chat-only result state and renders both Markdown and native renderer trees. |
| `src/lib/host-api-bridge.ts` | Just `stringify`, the JSON-with-bigint helper shared across components. |
| `src/components/ExampleEditor.tsx` | Monaco editor wrapper. Auto-folds `// #region helpers` blocks on mount. |
| `src/components/MethodView.tsx` | Per-method view: signature link to cargo doc, Example / Output tabs, status LED, Run / Stop buttons. Output is the example's `console.*` log; an explicit `assert`/error throw flips the LED to error and shows the thrown message. |
| `src/components/DiagnosisView.tsx` | Diagnosis screen (own sidebar entry): purpose + login/phone instructions, a Run button, a live per-method log (queued → processing… → success/failed) with per-row expand + replay, a summary showing success / failed counts (skipped methods are shown as failed, with the skip reason as their detail), and Copy report / Submit report buttons. Submit copies the full report to the clipboard and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue carrying a compact variant of it. |
| `src/components/ServiceTable.tsx` / `CommandPalette.tsx` | Method browser and ⌘K search. The browser also hosts the Diagnosis entry. |
| `src/app/page.tsx` | Root: connection status, selection state, deep-link sync via `pushState` + `popstate`. |

### Source of Truth for Methods

`@parity/truapi/playground/services` is generated from the truapi crate's rustdoc JSON. Each service may carry `requiredExecution`, and each method entry carries:

- `name`, `type` (`"unary"` or `"subscription"`)
- `signature`: the TS-shaped method signature shown in the API panel
- `docUrl`: a fragment (e.g. `api/account/trait.Account.html#method.get_account`) joined onto `NEXT_PUBLIC_CARGO_DOC_BASE` to link out to cargo doc
- `description`, `requestDescription`
- `exampleSource`: the `ts` rustdoc block, with `// #region helpers` blocks intact

To add or change a method, edit the trait in `rust/crates/truapi/src/api/*.rs` and rerun `./scripts/codegen.sh` from the repo root. Never edit the generated files directly.

### Call Flow

```
ServiceTable click / CommandPalette / ?service=…&method=… URL
  → page.tsx Selection state (pushState keeps the URL in sync)
    → MethodView mounts ExampleEditor with method.exampleSource
      → user clicks Run
        → example-runner: sucrase transpiles TS → wraps in AsyncFunction
          → executes with ambient `truapi` (a Proxy over the singleton client),
            `console`, rxjs, and `assert`
            → awaits the returned Promise (subscriptions self-await their first
              event via `firstValueFrom`); console output streams into the panel
            → resolves → success; throws (`assert`/error/timeout) → error
            → Stop cancels the run and unsubscribes any tracked subscriptions
```

A method without `exampleSource` shows a "Not supported" badge and disables the Run button. Adding support means writing a `ts` rustdoc block on the trait method.

### Transport

`transport.ts` auto-detects environment (iframe vs webview) and exposes singletons `getTransport()` and `getClient()`. The CLI's development-only blocking script creates a `MessageChannel`, bridges it to the loopback WebSocket, and installs one port as `window.__HOST_API_PORT__` before product code runs. The first call to `subscribeConnectionStatus()` triggers a generated `host_handshake` round-trip. The generated package owns both `TRUAPI_VERSION` and `TRUAPI_CODEC_VERSION`, so callers do not pass the codec version manually. Never create multiple transport or client instances.

The host accepts TCP frames only from a loopback peer. Browser WebSocket
requests also need a loopback `Origin`; local non-browser clients may omit it.
`yarn build` scans the exported `out/` tree and fails if the development bridge
URL survived production compilation.

In iframe mode the playground talks to its parent window via `postMessage` carrying SCALE-encoded `Uint8Array` frames. In webview mode it pulls a `MessagePort` from `window.__HOST_API_PORT__` (set by the native host) and uses `createMessagePortProvider`. The shared `@parity/truapi` transport also answers inbound `host_handshake_request` frames automatically by decoding the inbound versioned wrapper and encoding the matching `HostHandshakeResponse` variant, so V2 hosts receive V2 responses while V1 hosts remain decodable.

### Generated Artifacts

The following directories are gitignored and produced by `./scripts/codegen.sh` plus the playground's `prebuild`/`predev`:

- `src/lib/codegen/rxjs-dts.ts` — every `.d.ts` under `node_modules/rxjs/dist/types/`, snapshot for Monaco.
- `test/generated/examples/` — one file per method, lint-checked via `tsc -p tsconfig.examples.json`.
- `public/cargo_doc/` — `yarn dev` only: symlinks the local `target/doc/truapi/...` under Next's static `public/` so cargo-doc links stay http-origin (Chrome blocks `file://` from `http://`).
- `.env.development.local` — also dev-only, sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_CARGO_DOC_BASE=/cargo_doc`.
