# Definition of done

A change is end-to-end-verified locally when **all** of these pass.
Run them in order — each layer assumes the layer below it builds clean.

```
Rust crates  →  codegen  →  @parity/truapi  →  playground  →  dotli iframe
```

## Pre-flight (once per session)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
( cd js/packages/truapi && npm install )
( cd playground && yarn install --frozen-lockfile )
( cd hosts/dotli && bun install )
```

`bun: command not found` → install Bun
(`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`).

## The chain

- [ ] **Rust workspace** — invoke the `rust-checks` skill. All four
      cargo commands clean.
- [ ] **Codegen** — only if Rust trait surface changed. Invoke the
      `regen-codegen` skill, then commit
      `js/packages/truapi/src/{generated,playground}/`.
- [ ] **iOS bindings** — only if UniFFI-exposed types changed
      (`HostCallbacks`, `NativeTrUApiHostRuntime`, `NativeProductExecution`,
      the native mirror types in
      `rust/crates/truapi/src/native*`). Run
      `make uniffi && ./ios/truapi-host/scripts/sync-bindings.sh`, then
      commit `ios/truapi-host/Sources/`. Also update every hand-written
      conformer — `HostCallbackAdapter` in `TrUAPIHost.swift` and
      `TrUAPIHost.kt` — since regenerating alone leaves the package
      non-compiling. Swift conformers that implement `HostBridge` rather
      than the generated `HostCallbacks` pick up the extension defaults
      and usually need no change. `rebuild.sh` does all of the above plus
      the xcframework and container, but needs Xcode.
- [ ] **`@parity/truapi`** — invoke the `ts-client-checks` skill.
      `npm run build && npm test` clean.
- [ ] **Playground snapshot** — only if codegen ran or
      `js/packages/truapi/` changed. Invoke the
      `refresh-playground-snapshot` skill.
- [ ] **Playground statics** — invoke the `playground-checks` skill.
      `yarn build && yarn lint` clean.
- [ ] **End-to-end** — invoke the `e2e-dotli` skill. Either
      `cd playground && yarn e2e` (preferred) or the manual browser
      flow.

If any layer fails, fix it and rerun **that layer plus every layer
above it**. Skipping a layer because "I only changed X" is the most
common cause of the codegen ↔ snapshot mismatch.

## CI parity

GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same chain on
every PR. A green CI run is sufficient evidence for the static layers
(rust, codegen-drift, ios-bindings, ios-swift, ts-client, playground);
the e2e job runs the Playwright suite from the `e2e-dotli` skill against
a freshly built dotli host.

The `ios-bindings` job regenerates the Swift bindings, which proves
every UniFFI-exposed type still has a binding representation; nothing is
committed to diff against. The `ios-swift` job generates the package's
Swift sources and container resource, then compiles the package and its
test target on macOS, which is what catches a hand-written conformer
that misses a new protocol requirement. Both compile gates are
path-filtered from one place: the `changes` job in `ci.yml` publishes
`sdk_swift` and `sdk_kotlin`, and each gated job reads its output, so a
job shows as skipped where it does not apply.

The Kotlin side is covered too: `android-bindings` compiles
`TrUAPIHost.kt` against freshly generated bindings. Still uncovered:
the embedding apps are not built here at all.
